> Lightweight python package grouping together useful computer vision functions and operations

This package was initially created for myself to extract some of the most useful important functions,  
from packages like `scipy`, `skimage`, etc...  

This was done in order to expose all these very useful computer vision functions,  
and be able to use them in a **Serverless** environment.
